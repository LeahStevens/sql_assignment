sql_assignment
==============

Project for NSS BackEnd on Unit 2 SQL


 Goal:

Develop and demonstrate a command of SQL (using SQLite3)
We will later refactor this application to user ActiveRecord




Criteria:

It should be a command-line CRUD app (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
You can use gems
Should be relatively simple feature list, as the focus is on SQL mastery
