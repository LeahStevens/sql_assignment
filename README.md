Imports/Exports
==============

Project for NSS BackEnd on Unit 2 SQL


 **Goal:**
Develop and demonstrate a command of SQL (using SQLite3)
We will later refactor this application to user ActiveRecord


The idea behind getting the data from Imports and Exports is to query relations between countries. Specifically I would like to be able to get the countries that US does the most trade with.




**Criteria:**
It should be a command-line CRUD app (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
You can use gems
Should be relatively simple feature list, as the focus is on SQL mastery




**Feature List:**
Enter information from a set of data on imports and exports. 
I can query for top exports/imports based on country.
I can look for the country the US exports to most. 





**Interesting Queries**
I imagine there isn't much you can learn from my data that you can not learn from other data sets on exports/imports. However I am excited about pulling data from an external source, especially since it will make understanding data avaiable to the public easier.
